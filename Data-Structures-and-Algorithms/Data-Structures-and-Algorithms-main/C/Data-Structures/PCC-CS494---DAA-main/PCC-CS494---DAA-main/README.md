# PCC-CS494-C-CODES
Here are some C programs that I did for the PCC-CS494 assignments of the 4th semester in the 2nd year curriculum of B.Tech CSE.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```C``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo : ```git clone https://github.com/AbhishiktaRay03/PCC-CS494---DAA.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd <folder_name> ```.  
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

- To run any program (with <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -lm```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- Then type ``` ./a.out```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
